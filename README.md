# Gosu Wrapper [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UNO-IGDA/gosu_wrapper.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/UNO-IGDA/gosu_wrapper)

A wrapper library for Gosu (Ruby version), adding new functionality.
In this directory, you'll find the files needed to be able to package up
`GosuWrapper` into a gem. Put Ruby code in the file `lib/gosu_wrapper`.
To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gosu_wrapper'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install gosu_wrapper
```

## Usage
There are no usage instruction at this time.

## Development
After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console`
for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and
then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the
version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
